NagiosScripts
=============

Some Nagios Scripts we have adjusted/created as needed for our various environments.
Most of these are collaborations with our customers.

These scripts "work for me" (tm), but are not guaranteed to work for you.
If bad things happen when you use these, don't come crying back to me, unless
you have a a fix, then send a pull request. :)

Thanks
